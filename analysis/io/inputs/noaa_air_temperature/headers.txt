The station WBAN number. The UTC date of the observation. The UTC time of the observation. Time is the end of the observed hour, so the 0000 hour is actually the last hour of the previous day's observation (starting just after 11:00 PM through midnight). The Local Standard Time (LST) date of the observation. The Local Standard Time (LST) time of the observation. Time is the end of the observed hour (see UTC_TIME description). The version number of the station datalogger program that was in effect at the time of the observation. Note: This field should be treated as text (i.e. string). Station longitude, using WGS-84. Station latitude, using WGS-84. Average air temperature, in degrees C, during the last 5 minutes of the hour. See Note F. Average air temperature, in degrees C, for the entire hour. See Note F. Maximum air temperature, in degrees C, during the hour. See Note F. Minimum air temperature, in degrees C, during the hour. See Note F. Total amount of precipitation, in mm, recorded during the hour. See Note F. Average global solar radiation, in watts/meter^2. QC flag for average global solar radiation. See Note G. Maximum global solar radiation, in watts/meter^2. QC flag for maximum global solar radiation. See Note G. Minimum global solar radiation, in watts/meter^2. QC flag for minimum global solar radiation. See Note G. Type of infrared surface temperature measurement: 'R' denotes raw (uncorrected), 'C' denotes corrected, and 'U' when unknown/missing. See Note H. Average infrared surface temperature, in degrees C. See Note H. QC flag for infrared surface temperature. See Note G. Maximum infrared surface temperature, in degrees C. QC flag for infrared surface temperature maximum. See Note G. Minimum infrared surface temperature, in degrees C. QC flag for infrared surface temperature minimum. See Note G. RH average for hour, in percentage. See Note I. QC flag for RH average. See Note G. Average soil moisture at 5 cm below the surface, in m^3/m^3. See Note K. Average soil moisture at 10 cm below the surface, in m^3/m^3. See Note K. Average soil moisture at 20 cm below the surface, in m^3/m^3. See Note K. Average soil moisture at 50 cm below the surface, in m^3/m^3. See Note K.
